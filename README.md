## Individual Contributor License Agreement

If you, as an individual, own the contribution, you must sign the Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This signed CLA may be required before your contribution can be merged into the project repository. Please note that as an individual contributor, you are acting on your own behalf, not on behalf of your employer.

1. Open a PR against a repo that uses EasyCLA.
2. When blocked by the bot, follow the prompts and choose Individual.
3. Fill in the details and sign the DocuSign form.
4. Wait a little while for the check to re-run.

The margo initiative defines mechanisms for interoperation between edge applications, devices, and orchestration software through ― amongst others ― an open standard at home in this repository.

[Contribution flow process ](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJfhlCYM=/?share_link_id=610857134424) - This flow process delineates the systematic approach utilised by the Technical Working Group for the evaluation and processing of submissions made by non-member Margo. It encompasses a series of defined stages, ensuring that each submission is rigorously reviewed in alignment with established criteria and protocols. The process is designed to facilitate transparency, efficiency, and thoroughness, thereby fostering a robust framework for collaboration and innovation within the group.

# MARGO Contribution Process Workflow Outline

## Overview
This flowchart illustrates the contribution and review process for the MARGO (Marine Arctic Regional Geoheritage Observatory) project, highlighting the various pathways for members and non-members, as well as the different categories of submissions.

## Key Features:
- Dual entry points for Non-Members and MARGO Members
- Category classification (Cat 1 vs Cat 2) with different processing paths
- EasyCLA compliance checks as critical gates
- Technical Working Group (TWG) review process
- Member review and approval stages
- Decision diamonds for all the key checkpoint questions
- Colour coding to distinguish different types of actors and processes

## Main Process Steps

### 1. Initial Submission Classification
- **Category 1 (Cat 1)**: Standard pull request submissions
- **Category 2 (Cat 2)**: Specification enhancement proposals requiring SUP (Specification Update Process)

### 2. Contributor Pathways

#### **Non-Member Path**
1. Contributor gains GitHub access to specification enhancement repository
2. Submits Cat 1 or Cat 2 contribution following submission guide
3. Must complete EasyCLA (Easy Contributor License Agreement) process

#### **MARGO Member Path** 
1. Direct submission of Cat 1 or Cat 2 contributions
2. EasyCLA verification required

### 3. Category 1 (Cat 1) Process Flow

#### **Initial Review**
1. **Issue Triage**: PMG weekly meetings assign and triage submissions
2. **EasyCLA Check**: System verifies contributor license agreement
   - If unsigned: PR will not be reviewed (process stops)
   - If signed: Process continues

#### **TWG Review Stage**
3. **MARGO TWG Review**: Technical Working Group evaluates submission
4. **Comment Decision Point**: 
   - If no comments submitted: Chair closes issue
   - If comments submitted: Submitter provides response

#### **Member Review & Approval**
5. **PR Triage and Assignment**: Pull request gets assigned for detailed review
6. **MARGO Members Review**: Members review and approve pull request
7. **Comments/Objections Check**:
   - If comments/objections submitted: Resolution process begins
   - If no issues: Proceeds to final approval

#### **Final Resolution**
8. **Member Objections Assessment**:
   - If objections resolved: PR approved and merged by Chair
   - If not resolved: PR closed by Chair

### 4. Category 2 (Cat 2) Process Flow

#### **SUP Process**
1. **Cat 2 Issue Creation**: SUP proposal submitted
2. **Issue Triage**: PMG weekly meetings and assignment
3. **TWG Review**: MARGO TWG review with comment submission
4. **Decision Point**:
   - If no comments: Chair closes issue
   - If comments: Submitter starts SUP process based on TWG feedback
5. **Process Integration**: Added to PM (Project Management) process

## Critical Decision Points

### **EasyCLA Compliance Gate**
- All contributors must sign EasyCLA
- Unsigned agreements halt the review process

### **TWG Feedback Gate**
- Technical Working Group comments determine next steps
- No comments = immediate closure
- Comments trigger response/SUP process

### **Member Review Gate**
- MARGO members provide final technical review
- Comments and objections must be resolved
- Chair has final merge/close authority

## Process Outcomes

### **Success Paths**
- **Cat 1**: PR approved and merged by Chair
- **Cat 2**: Added to PM process for implementation

### **Closure Paths**
- Chair closes issue (insufficient feedback/comments)
- PR closed due to unresolved objections
- Process stopped due to EasyCLA non-compliance

## Key Governance Principles
- **Sign-off Framework**: All contributions require proper authorization
- **Transparency**: Clear review stages with defined stakeholders
- **Member Oversight**: MARGO members maintain quality control
- **Chair Authority**: Final decision-making power for approvals and closures

This workflow ensures quality control, proper licensing compliance, and structured review processes for both routine contributions and major specification enhancements within the MARGO project ecosystem.
