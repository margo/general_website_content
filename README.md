# Contributing

[Contribution flow process In Detail ](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJfhlCYM=/?share_link_id=610857134424) - This flow process incorporates two systematic approaches, ([Cat 1](https://github.com/margo/specification/tree/pre-draft?tab=readme-ov-file#choose-cat-1--submit-pr--easycla--review--approve--merge) & [Cat 2](https://github.com/margo/specification/tree/pre-draft?tab=readme-ov-file#choose-cat-2--specification-update-process--sup-process--easycla--review--approve--merge)) utilised by the Technical Working Group for the evaluation and processing of submissions made by non-Margo members. It encompasses a series of defined stages, ensuring that each submission is rigorously reviewed in alignment with established criteria and protocols. The process is designed to facilitate transparency, efficiency, and thoroughness, thereby fostering a robust framework for collaboration and innovation within the group.

# Individual Contributor

If you, as an individual, own the contribution, you **MUST SIGN** the Individual [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/margo/EasyCLA-public-feedback) (CLA) at the point of submitting a PR. This signed CLA will be required before your contribution can be merged into the project repository. Just so you know, as an individual contributor, you are acting on your own behalf and not on your employer.

# Submission Steps

**Step 1:** The Contributor selects either Category 1 or Category 2 based on the type of submission proposal.

**Category 1 (Cat 1):** Minor Bug Report Issue or pull request submission to suggest a simple editorial change

**Category 2 (Cat 2):** Specification Enhancement Request detailing a suggested function proposal.

**ALL** Non-member PR submissions must sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/margo/EasyCLA-public-feedback).
