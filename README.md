# Contributing

[Contribution flow process In Detail ](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJfhlCYM=/?share_link_id=610857134424) - This flow process incorporates two systematic approaches, ([Cat 1](https://github.com/margo/specification/tree/pre-draft?tab=readme-ov-file#choose-cat-1--submit-pr--easycla--review--approve--merge) & [Cat 2](https://github.com/margo/specification/tree/pre-draft?tab=readme-ov-file#choose-cat-2--specification-update-process--sup-process--easycla--review--approve--merge)) utilised by the Technical Working Group for the evaluation and processing of submissions made by non-member Margo. It encompasses a series of defined stages, ensuring that each submission is rigorously reviewed in alignment with established criteria and protocols. The process is designed to facilitate transparency, efficiency, and thoroughness, thereby fostering a robust framework for collaboration and innovation within the group.

# Individual Contributor

If you, as an individual, own the contribution, you **MUST SIGN** the Individual [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/margo/EasyCLA-public-feedback) (CLA) at the point of submitting a PR. This signed CLA will be required before your contribution can be merged into the project repository. Just so you know, as an individual contributor, you are acting on your own behalf and not on your employer.

# Submission Steps
**Step 1:** The Contributor selects either Category 1 or Category 2 based on the type of submission proposal.
  - [Category 1 (Cat 1)](https://github.com/margo/specification/tree/pre-draft?tab=readme-ov-file#choose-cat-1--submit-pr--easycla--review--approve--merge): Minor [issues](https://github.com/margo/specification/issues) outlining a bug or [pull request](https://github.com/margo/specification/pulls) submission to suggest a simple editorial change
  - [Category 2 (Cat 2)](https://github.com/margo/specification/tree/pre-draft?tab=readme-ov-file#choose-cat-2--specification-update-process--sup-process--easycla--review--approve--merge): Specification major enhancement proposals require following the [Specification Update Process](https://github.com/margo/specification-enhancements)

> These workflows ensure quality control, proper licensing compliance, and structured review processes for both routine contributions and major specification enhancements within the MARGO project ecosystem.

**ALL** Non-member PR submissions must sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/margo/EasyCLA-public-feedback).  

## Process Outcomes

### **Success Paths**
- **Cat 1**: PR approved by TWG members and merged by Chair
- **Cat 2**: Reviewed and approved by the SUP committee

### **Closure Paths**
- Chair closes issue (insufficient feedback/comments)
- PR closed due to unresolved objections
- Process stopped due to EasyCLA non-compliance

## Key Governance Principles
- **Sign-off Framework**: All contributions require proper authorization
- **Transparency**: Clear review stages with defined stakeholders
- **Member Oversight**: MARGO members maintain quality control
- **Chair Authority**: Final decision-making power for approvals and closures
