title: "Application Registry"
---

This section describes the Application Registry and the exchange of an [application package](./application-package-definition.mdx) from an Application Developer to the Workload Fleet Manager (WFM). 

The Application Developer SHALL use a [Git repository](https://git-scm.com/) to share an [application package](./application-package-definition.mdx). This Git repository is considered the Application Registry. 

The connectivity between the Workload Fleet Manager and the Application Registry SHALL be read-only. 

Upon installation request from the End User, the Workload Fleet Manager SHALL retrieve the [application package](./application-package-definition.mdx) using a ``git pull`` request from the Application Registry. 

The Workload Fleet Manager reads in the application description file, ``margo.yaml``, and presents a user interface that allows the specification of parameters available according to ``margo.yaml``. 

The End User then specifies the configuration parameters for the [application package](./application-package-definition.mdx). 

Then, the [application package](./application-package-definition.mdx) is ready to be passed on to the installation process.  

> **Note** 
> The specifics of the installation process are still under discussion: this could be for example a GitOps based approach. 

During this process the containers referenced in the application manifest ([Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/docs/) or [Compose](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/03-compose-file.md)) are retrieved from container/Helm registries. 

At a minimum, a Margo-compliant Workload Fleet Manager SHALL provide a way for an end user to manually set up a connection between the Workload Fleet Manager and an application registry. This is required so as not to prohibit an end user from being able to install any Margo-compliant application they wish, including applications developed by the end user.  

The Workload Fleet Manager MAY provide enhanced user experience options such as the pre-configuring of application registries to monitor. These can include application registries from third-party application vendors or their own applications. 

## Secure Access to the Application Package 

It is expected the connection between the Workload Fleet Manager and the Application developer’s application registry is secured using standard secure connectivity best practices. Some standard practices include the following: 

- Basic authentication via HTTPS 
- Bearer token authentication 
- TLS certifications
