## Multiple Personas per Entity

In some cases, a single entity, such as a company or organization, may provide multiple roles within the Margo enabled ecosystem. Below are a few examples of this with some visualizations.

### Combination of Device Supplier and Platform Supplier

A supplier may be both the device supplier (the underlying hardware) and the platform provider, selling a "ready to deploy" offering for consumption by end users:

### Combination of Workload Supplier and OT User

A persona in the end user category, such as an OT user, could also internally develop an application, and leverage the Margo specification to ease deployment to devices in their environment:
