  Schema for defining application metadata, deployment profiles, parameters, and configuration. 
  The purpose of this file is to present the application on an application catalog or marketplace 
  from where an end user selects the application to hand it over to the Workload Orchestration Software, 
  which configures it and makes it available for installation on the edge device.
