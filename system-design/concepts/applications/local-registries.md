# Local Registries

The [Component Registry](application-registry.md) as well as the [Container Image Registry](application-registry.md) considered by Margo are the registries that need to be accessed by devices to download components (i.e., Helm Charts or Compose Archives) or container images.
This section describes how to configure those as local registries to avoid reliance on public Internet-accessible registries.

The reasons for not using public registries are for example: (1) publicly hosted container images or Helm charts could become unavailable at some point, as the owner decides to take the container images or Helm charts off the public registry, (2) Internet connectivity may not be available to the device and hence public registries are not reachable, or (3) end-users want to host their own registries so they can do security scans and package validation.

In terms of connectivity, we can thereby distinguish mainly between the following device categories:

1. **Fully connected device**, which means a device is deployed in the field (e.g., a factory shop floor) and has access to the Internet.
2. **Locally connected device**, i.e., the device has connectivity to a local network (e.g., factory- or enterprise-wide) and a local repository can be made reachable.
3. **Air-gapped device**, i.e., the device generally is not connected and must be configured by accessing it directly (via direct network link with an Ethernet cable, or similar) for example through a technician’s laptop.

Local Component Registries or Container Image Registries can be used for all device categories.
In case of **fully connected devices**, although the device could reach the Internet, a local registry can still be useful (e.g., as a cache for remote registries to save on bandwidth or to have container images or Helm Charts reliably available).
In case of **locally connected devices**, a local registry is required to enable the Workload Fleet Management Client (WFMC) to install a Margo application on the device, as the device/WFMC does not have Internet access.
Thereby, the local registry can be set up as a *pull-through cache* where data (e.g., container images) is cached locally when they are first retrieved from a remote source and subsequent requests for the same data are served from the local cache rather than fetching it again from the remote source.
In case of **air-gapped devices**, a local registry has to be accessible on the technician's laptop (or other directly connected device), which performs the application installation process.

To setup local registries, different configuration options exist:

## Option - Container Image Registry Mirror on Kubernetes Level

Kubernetes supports the configuration of registry mirrors. How this is configured depends on the distribution and the underlying container runtime. Distributions that utilize **containerd** as runtime (e.g., k3s or microk8s) allow the definition of mirrors in a configuration file. For example, in k3s the file `/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml` can be used to set up a mirror for each device's Kubernetes environment:

```yaml
mirrors:
  "docker.io":
    endpoint:
      - "http://<local-registry-ip>:5000"
configs:
  "docker.io":
    auth:
      username: "<username>"
      password: "<password>"
```

## Option - Container Image Registry as Pull-through Cache on Docker Level

To configure a pull-through cache in Docker for the Container Image Registry, a Docker Registry can be setup that acts as caching proxy for a remote Docker Registry. Such a Docker Registry can be defined using the following `config.yml`:

```yaml
version: 0.1
log:
  fields:
    service: registry
storage:
  filesystem:
    rootdirectory: /var/lib/registry
http:
  addr: :5000
  headers:
    X-Content-Type-Options: [nosniff]
health:
  storagedriver:
    enabled: true
    interval: 10s
    threshold: 3
proxy:
  remoteurl: https://registry-1.docker.io
```

This registry can be started uing the following command:
`docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart unless-stopped --name registry -v $(pwd)/config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml registry:2`

Then, the Docker daemon needs to be configured to use the private registry as a mirror in the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file:

```json
{
  "registry-mirrors": ["http://10.100.2.102:5000"],
  "insecure-registries": ["10.100.2.102:5000"]
}
```

## Option - Helm Chart Component Registry as Pull-through Cache

Setting up a pull-through cache for Helm charts in combination with Kubernetes involves configuring a local Helm chart repository, e.g., ChartMuseum, that can be installed with the `PROXY_CACHE` variable set to `true`:

```bash
helm repo add chartmuseum https://chartmuseum.github.io/charts
helm repo update
helm install my-chartmuseum chartmuseum/chartmuseum --set env.open.DISABLE_API=false --set env.open.PROXY_CACHE=true
```

Then, this Helm Chart repository can be added to Helm and chart releases can be installed there:

```bash
helm repo add my-cached-repo http://<chartmuseum-ip>:8080
helm repo update
helm install my-release my-cached-repo/<chart-name>
```

Now, when deploying applications in Kubernetes using Helm, the cached repository is used to serve charts rather than the remote repository.
