# What is Margo?

![(Margo )](./figures/margo-logo.svg)

The Margo initiative is an open collaboration between like-minded organizations and individuals, sharing a common vision: deliver edge interoperability for industrial automation ecosystems. Margo is hosted by the Linux Foundation.

Find out more about the Margo initiative and how to become engaged at [margo.org](https://www.margo.org/).

> **Disclaimer**

Preview Release 1 of the Margo Specification draft in the [Margo Specification](https://github.com/margo/specification) repository is a work in progress.

The APIs are currently incomplete and may still change. However, implementing PR1 would be very useful for building prototypes. It offers a practical way to get a head start and to confirm that the specification has the appropriate scope. GA1 will include stable APIs and conformance tools.

## Mission Statement

Margo’s mission emphasizes unlocking innovation barriers in industrial automation through edge interoperability. This is achieved through creation of a reference implementation, open standard, and compliance testing toolkit to facilitate the interoperable fleet management of edge applications and devices. The Margo initiative aims to accelerate digital transformation by simplifying the deployment, scalability, and operation of industrial solutions, thereby enabling organizations to innovate and grow more efficiently.

## Addressing Industrial Edge Pain Points

Because of recent trends in industrial manufacturing, lifecycle management is becoming a challenge because of the massive increase of compute devices and apps from a multitude of suppliers deployed in plants. Margo intends to reduce the complexity of maintaining and operating such an infrastructure at scale in a multi-vendor environment.

## Applying an Open Approach

While Margo intends to address innovation barriers, this cannot be done without widespread collaboration and interaction with peer communities.

## An Edge Interoperability User Story

Interoperability is a challenge with multiple facets and personas. In order to stay focused on solving the market’s pain points, Margo’s contributors use a persona based user story as the tangible guideline for the collaboration.

## Delivering the Interoperability Promise

Margo relies on a few principles in tackling the interoperability challenge and simplifying the process of building, deploying, scaling, and operating complex, multi-vendor edge environments for organizations of all sizes.
