## Mission Statement

Margo’s mission emphasizes unlocking innovation barriers in industrial automation through edge interoperability. This is achieved through creation of a reference implementation, open standard, and compliance testing toolkit to facilitate the interoperable fleet management of edge applications and devices. The Margo initiative aims to accelerate digital transformation by simplifying the deployment, scalability, and operation of industrial solutions, thereby enabling organizations to innovate and grow more efficiently.

## Addressing Industrial Edge Pain Points

Because of recent trends in industrial manufacturing, lifecycle management is becoming a challenge because of the massive increase of compute devices and apps from a multitude of suppliers deployed in plants. Margo intends to reduce the complexity of maintaining and operating such an infrastructure at scale in a multi-vendor environment.

## Applying an Open Approach

While Margo intends to address innovation barriers, this cannot be done without widespread collaboration and interaction with peer communities.

## An Edge Interoperability User Story

Interoperability is a challenge with multiple facets and personas. In order to stay focused on solving the market’s pain points, Margo’s contributors use a persona based user story as the tangible guideline for the collaboration.
